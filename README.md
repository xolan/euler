This repo is my private (but public...) attempts to solve all problems at Project Euler.

Requires python3!

Files prefixed with an 'a' should be providing a valid answer.
Files pn.py (where 'n' is a number) are incomplete or invalid solutions to problem #n.

Other random files are probably just helpers.
