http://projecteuler.net/problems

This repo is my private (but public...) attempts to solve all problems at Project Euler.

Some problems might require python3! (I made the switched during solving...)

Files prefixed with an 'a' should be providing a valid answer.
Files pn.py (where 'n' is a number) are incomplete or invalid solutions to problem #n.

Other random files are probably just helpers.
